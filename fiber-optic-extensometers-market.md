<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Extensometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-Type Extensometers</li><li>Non Contact-Type Extensometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic extensometers are used for measuring deformation and strain in materials. Contact-type extensometers make physical contact with the material being measured, allowing for accurate readings but potential damage to the sample. Non-contact-type extensometers use optical methods to measure strain without touching the sample, minimizing the risk of damage but potentially sacrificing accuracy. Both types of extensometers are widely used in various industries such as construction, manufacturing, and research for quality control and material testing purposes.</p></p>
