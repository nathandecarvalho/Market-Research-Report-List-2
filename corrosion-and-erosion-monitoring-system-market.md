<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion and Erosion Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-intrusive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Corrosion and erosion monitoring systems can be classified into two main types: intrusive and non-intrusive. Intrusive monitoring systems involve the direct contact of sensors with the surface of the material being monitored, providing accurate and real-time data on the extent of corrosion or erosion. On the other hand, non-intrusive monitoring systems use external methods such as ultrasonic or electromagnetic techniques to assess the condition of the material without physically interacting with it. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries for effective asset management.</p></p>
