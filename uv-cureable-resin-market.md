<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV Cureable Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solventborne UV Resins</li><li>Waterborne UV Resins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UV curable resins are divided into two main types: Solventborne UV Resins and Waterborne UV Resins. Solventborne UV Resins use organic solvents as the carrier for the resin, allowing for easier application and faster curing times. However, these solvents can be harmful to the environment and pose health risks. On the other hand, Waterborne UV Resins use water as the carrier, making them more environmentally friendly and safer for use. Both types offer quick curing times and high durability, making them ideal for various industrial applications.</p></p>
