<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-Proof Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type Sealants</li><li>Intumescent Type Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-proof sealants are commonly classified into two main types - Elastomeric Type Sealants and Intumescent Type Sealants. Elastomeric sealants are flexible and rubber-like, able to expand and contract with the surrounding surfaces. They are used primarily for filling gaps and joints in construction materials. Intumescent sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming a protective, insulating barrier against fire. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing the fire resistance of buildings and structures.</p></p>
