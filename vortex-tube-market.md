<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vortex Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled (Adiabatic)</li><li>Cooled (Nonadiabatic)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vortex tube market consists of two main types: uncooled (adiabatic) and cooled (nonadiabatic). Uncooled vortex tubes operate based on the principle of adiabatic expansion, generating hot and cold air streams without any external cooling mechanism. On the other hand, cooled vortex tubes utilize an external cooling mechanism to enhance the cooling effect of the cold air stream. Both types have their unique applications and advantages, catering to different industrial and commercial needs for temperature control and air separation.</p></p>
