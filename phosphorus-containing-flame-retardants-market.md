<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phosphorus-containing Flame Retardants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic</li><li>Organic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phosphorus-containing flame retardants are classified into two main types: inorganic and organic. Inorganic phosphorus flame retardants are salts or oxides of phosphorus, such as ammonium polyphosphate. They are typically used in intumescent systems to provide a physical barrier between the flame and the substrate. Organic phosphorus flame retardants, on the other hand, contain phosphorus within a molecular structure, such as organophosphates. They act by releasing phosphoric acid when exposed to heat, forming a protective char layer to prevent the spread of flames.</p></p>
