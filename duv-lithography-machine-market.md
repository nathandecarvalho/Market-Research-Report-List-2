<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DUV Lithography Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Submerged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DUV lithography machines are used in semiconductor manufacturing to transfer circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. There are two types of DUV lithography machines - dry and submerged. In dry machines, the wafer is exposed to ultraviolet light in a vacuum environment, while in submerged machines, the wafer is placed in a chamber filled with a liquid medium during exposure. Both types have their advantages and limitations, with dry machines offering faster throughput and submerged machines providing better resolution and depth of focus.</p></p>
