<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bonded Ferrite Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injected Magnets</li><li>Pressed Magnets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bonded ferrite magnets are commonly available in two main market types: Injected magnets and pressed magnets. Injected magnets are produced by injecting a mixture of ferrite powder and polymer into a mold under heat and pressure. This process allows for complex shapes and high dimensional accuracy. Pressed magnets, on the other hand, are made by compacting the mixture into a desired shape using pressure before being sintered. Pressed magnets are typically more cost-effective for simpler shapes and larger quantities.</p></p>
