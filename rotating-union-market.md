<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotating Union Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Passage</li><li>Single-Passage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotating unions can be classified into two main types based on the number of passages they have: multi-passage and single-passage. Multi-passage rotating unions have multiple passages that allow for the transfer of different media simultaneously, making them ideal for applications where multiple fluids or gases need to be transferred at the same time. On the other hand, single-passage rotating unions have only one passage, making them suitable for simpler applications that only require the transfer of a single medium.</p></p>
